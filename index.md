## Projects

---

### [ARP spoofer](https://github.com/PrajwalNa/Spoofer)

- The project is a Python script that uses the scapy library to perform a **‘man in the middle’** attack by spoofing the MAC and IP addresses of a network device.
- It allows the user to **intercept** network traffic between a target device and the router.
- User input is taken via the command line using the **argparse module** to specify the target device and the router.
- When terminated, the script can restore the original network configuration.
- Challenges faced include learning to use the **scapy library**, implementing the logic for spoofing and the attack techniques, accurately addressing and modifying the fields in the network packets, and handling exceptions and errors.
- The project provided learning outcomes in Python programming, **network security concepts**, network analysis and troubleshooting tools, and project management and documentation best practices.

### [Network Scanner](https://github.com/PrajwalNa/NetScanner)

- The project is a **network scanning tool** written in Python, capable of scanning IP addresses for active devices and open ports.
- It uses the **argparse module** for user input, **scapy library** for sending/receiving ARP packets, and **regular expressions** for input validation.
- The tool probes for open ports using techniques like **TCP Connect Scan, Stealth Scan (TCP SYN Scan), TCP ACK Scan, TCP Window Scan, and UDP Scan**.
- It uses an **external API** to identify the manufacturer of the network interface of active devices.
- The project employs **multithreading** to distribute the workload and speed up the scanning process.
- Challenges faced include learning about network scanning techniques, implementing multithreading, understanding Python Class objects, and handling exceptions.
- The project resulted in learning outcomes in **Python programming**, network scanning techniques, multithreading, and modularity.

### [Palindrome Word Checker and other cool little programs in 8086 Assembly](https://github.com/PrajwalNa/ASM)

- The project is an ongoing learning adventure in understanding how computers work at a low level, focusing on **8086 microprocessor assembly** and the general **x86 ISA**.
- Several programs have been written in **assembly**, including a **palindrome word checker** and a **basic encryption algorithm**.
- The project features include handling **I/O operations** using **BIOS interrupts**, using the **stack** for data storage and retrieval, implementing program logic with **branching and looping**, and making code more readable with **procedures and macros**.
- Challenges faced include understanding different **memory addressing modes**, proper usage of the **stack**, finding the right **BIOS interrupt** for specific operations, and managing **program control flow**.
- The project has led to learning outcomes such as understanding **assembly programming**, **low-level computer operations**, **stack operations**, and **BIOS interrupts** of the 8086 microprocessor.
- The exploration and learning in this domain continue, with interest in **modern x86-64 assembly** and **ARM assembly**.
- Recently made a simple **paint** application in ASM, used mouse initialisation in 8086. [Check it out here](https://github.com/PrajwalNa/PaintASM)

### [Linear Regression Model](https://github.com/PrajwalNa/LinearModel)

- The project is a ML model created using PyTorch that implements a **linear regression model** using the **ADAM optimisation algorithm**.
- The model is trained on a dataset of random data points and is capable of predicting the output for new data points.
- The project uses **PyTorch** for creating the model, **matplotlib** for visualising the data and the model, and **cuda tensors** for tensor processing.
- I have learned about **gradient descent**, **backpropagation**, **optimisation algorithms**, **loss functions**, and **model evaluation**.
- The project has provided insights into **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **PyTorch**, and **data visualisation**.
